HTML
<br>
<br>
<b>Major pieces of the web</b>
<br>
<br>
user, computer/browser, internet, servers

<br>

HTML heart of the web
<br>
text content
<br>
markup- what it looks like
<br>
references to other documents- video and images
<br>
links to other pages
<br>
HTML uses tags
<br>
opening tag/closing tag
<br>
open to close tag is called an element
<br>
<br>
 b bold (>  not included because<br>
 I don't know how to get the html to not read the > tags)<br>
 <b>it looks like this though</b>
<br>
<br>
em tag is italics
<br>
<em>wow much cool very slant</em>
<br>
<b>>HTML attributes</b>
<br>
<br>
tag ATTR=”value” contents /tag
<br>
attributes are additional information on elements
<br>
anchor tag a href= this is how you link something
<br>
<br>
img images
img src(means source)=”url” alt=”text”
<br>
alt is what displays if image doesn't display
<br>
some webcomics I read have hidden messages in<br>
the alt text, now i know how they do it.
<br>
void tag doesn't need close
<br>
<br>
whitespace
<br>
br means break (void tag) I use the br tag liberally
<br> in my html for these notes
<br>there's got to be an easier way to do it
<br>I am certain there is
